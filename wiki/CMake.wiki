==What is CMake?==
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/project/about.html :
 CMake is an extensible, open-source system that manages the build process in an operating system and in a compiler-independent manner. Unlike many cross-platform systems, CMake is designed to be used in conjunction with the native build environment.
