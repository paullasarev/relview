==What is Qt?==
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_%28framework%29L:
 Qt (pronounced officially as cute /ˈkjuːt/, though often unofficially pronounced as Q.T. /ˈkjuːˈtiː/) is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with a graphical user interface (GUI) (in which cases Qt is classified as a widget toolkit), and also used for developing non-GUI programs such as command-line tools and consoles for servers.
